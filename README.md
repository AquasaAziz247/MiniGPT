# 🧠 MiniGPT — A Tiny Transformer-based Language Model Built from Scratch

MiniGPT is a lightweight and educational implementation of a GPT-style Transformer language model, built entirely from scratch. It demonstrates how modern LLMs (Large Language Models) like GPT-2 work at the architectural and code level.

> This project is perfect for students, educators, and developers who want to **learn and experiment** with how LLMs function internally.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Pure Transformer architecture with:
  - Multi-head self-attention
  - Positional embeddings
  - Layer normalization & residuals
- ✅ Custom tokenizer
- ✅ Causal (left-to-right) text generation
- ✅ Modular and readable codebase
- ✅ Easy to train and extend for small datasets

---

## 📌 Use Cases

- 🔍 Learn how GPT models are built and trained
- 🧪 Experiment with prompt generation
- 📚 Educational resource for NLP/AI courses
- 🛠️ Base for adding:
  - Fine-tuning
  - RAG pipelines
  - Prompt engineering techniques
  - API & tool integrations

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

```plaintext
Input Text → Tokenizer → Embedding → [Transformer Block x N] → Linear Head → Output Tokens
Each Transformer Block includes:

Multi-head causal self-attention

Feed-forward network (FFN)

LayerNorm + residual connections
