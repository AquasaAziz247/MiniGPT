# 🧠 MiniGPT — A Tiny Transformer-based Language Model Built from Scratch##

MiniGPT is a simplified implementation of a GPT-style Transformer language model designed for educational purposes. It demonstrates how large language models like GPT-2 work under the hood, without the complexity of production-scale models.

⚙️ Built using only essential deep learning tools (e.g., PyTorch or NumPy) to focus on concepts, architecture, and logic rather than high-level libraries.

✨ Features
✅ Implements tokenization, embedding, multi-head self-attention, and transformer blocks

✅ Supports causal (autoregressive) text generation

✅ Clean, minimal codebase with well-structured files

✅ Ideal for learning LLM internals and experimenting with GPT architecture

🛠️ Future-ready for integration with vector stores, APIs, or LangChain

📌 Use Cases (Educational)
Learn how GPT models process and generate text

Use as a base for experimenting with:

Prompt engineering

Fine-tuning on small datasets

Building custom RAG or agent pipelines

🧱 Architecture Overview

Input Text → Tokenizer → Embeddings → Transformer Blocks (Multi-head Attention + FFN + LN) → Output Tokens
Each Transformer Block includes:

Layer Normalization

Multi-head Causal Self-Attention

Feed-Forward Network

Residual Connections

🧪 Examples

from minigpt.model import MiniGPT

model = MiniGPT.load("checkpoints/minigpt.pt")

prompt = "The future of AI is"
output = model.generate(prompt, max_tokens=20)
print(output)
Output (example):
